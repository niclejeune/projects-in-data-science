## Annotation process:
As the first step we separated the group's pictures from the dataset according to the provided *image_ids_groups.csv* with our script *copy_groups_images.sh*. In total 128 pictures had to be annotated by us. Before the process, we devided the pictures into 5 parts, and moved each to the annotator named folder for further processing - *moving_images_by_annotator.py*.  We used **a1, a2, a3, a4** and **a5** for anonimity, each annotator's image ids can be found in the *groupA_imageids.csv*. 

The labeling process was done by each group member individually, manually by hand with Label Studio.

### a5:
 - Some of the lesions had no exact separating lines
 - In 8 cases there were mutiple lesions on the picture - labeled all of them
 - No picture of *a5 annotation group* was left out
